# 🧠 Codewars Practice – Daily Katas

This repository contains my daily problem-solving practice on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/nruiz209487),  
focused on mastering **JavaScript** (frontend and backend) and **Python** (scripting and tooling).

Each kata is solved independently and versioned by date.  
I'm committed to solving at least **2 challenges per day**, aiming to build discipline, improve algorithmic thinking, and sharpen coding fluency.

### 💡 Why this matters

Daily problem-solving helps me:

- Think clearly under constraints
- Write more robust, readable, and optimized code
- Spot edge cases and logical pitfalls early
- Prepare for real-world debugging and interviews
